# Chest-Xray-Diagnosis-with-DenseNet
Chest Xray Diagnosis With DenseNet - Machine Learning Project for Medical Diagnosis
In this I explored a medical image diagnosis by building a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras. 

This directory will walk through some of the steps of building and evaluating this deep learning classifier model. In particular, i will:
- Pre-process and prepare a real-world X-ray dataset.
- Use transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification.
- Learn a technique to handle class imbalance
- Measure diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve.
- Visualize model activity using GradCAMs.

Following items have been performed within this directory: 

- Data preparation
  - Visualizing data.
  - Preventing data leakage.
- Model Development
  - Addressing class imbalance.
  - Leveraging pre-trained models using transfer learning.
- Evaluation
  - AUC and ROC curves.
